# brain2-api

Django REST API code for a self hosted "second brain".

The current functionality has models defined for keeping track of books, their authors, notes in the book, and tags for books, as well as tags for notes.

The API can be used however you want, but it is designed to work with data from [KOReader](https://github.com/koreader/koreader), [Calibre](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/calibre) and this [KOReader Calibre Plugin](https://git.sr.ht/~harmtemolder/koreader-calibre-plugin).

[This code](https://github.com/AmmarNanjiani/KOReader-Calbre-Sidecar-Parser) can be used to parse the data from Calibre and the plugin.
